# Troubleshoot

If you're getting an error like this:

## **Problem:** Podfile is out of date please try 'pod repo update'

This could be caused because the following line in podfile:

```dart
pod 'FirebaseFirestore', :git => 'https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks.git', :tag => '8.0.0'
```

The number `'8.0.0'` could mismatch the Firebase version specified in the Podfile.lock. This usually happens when the Podile.lock is changed somehow.

### **To fix this problem you can try the following:**

- Instead of `'8.0.0'` or any version you wrote, change that number to the
  number your Podfile.lock specifies.

### **If this does not work, you can try the following:**

1. Delete your Podfile, Podfile.lock, and the Pods directory in your ios directory
2. Run `flutter clean` in the terminal
3. Run `flutter pub get` in the terminal
4. Run `flutter run` in the terminal

After following these steps, you can then go to the following [THIS](https://github.com/invertase/firestore-ios-sdk-frameworks) github repository to check all the firestore ios sdk framework versions and use the latest or any other version that matches your Podfile.lock

## **Problem:** file not found #import <Flutter/Flutter.h>

```
Xcode's output:
â†³
    In file included from /usr/local/Caskroom/flutter/2.2.3/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/path_provider-2.0.2/ios/Classes/FLTPathProviderPlugin.m:5:

    file not found
    #import <Flutter/Flutter.h>
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    1 error generated.
```

### **This is the only solution that worked for me:**

1. Backup `ios/Runner` folder.

2. Delete the `ios` folder.

3. Run `flutter create (your project name)`. in the previous folder where you have your project(`cd users/user/"projects_folder"`) (this will recreate your `ios` folder).

4. Paste your Runner backup in the `ios` folder (into the project).

5. Open `Runner.xcworkspace` (into `ios` folder) and there, check the Version, the Bundle ID, all the info.

6. (If do you Have Firebase, you have to copy and paste again the `GoogleService-Info.Plist` into the `Runner` folder (Always through Xcode) (If do you do this manually, it doesn't work).

Finally, flutter run and should work!

If flutter run fails:

1. `cd ios`
2. `pod install`
3. `cd ..`
4. `flutter run`
